 /* This is a Tooltip's Library maded by me, Juan, here I
  Will Show you How It Works:

	The Fluxer Tooltip's System is based on two elements:

	 * The Script (this)
	 * The Stylesheet

	 In the Scripts is the funcionality of the Tooltip´s System,
	 is encharged of pick-up a element with a especific id attribute
	 and let magic happens, this, calling at the Stylesheet.

	  Id's:

	 Here's a list of the id's attributes for work:

	 tt-normal - A simple Tooltip

	 tt-md - A medium size Tooltip

	 tt-lg - A big Tooltip
